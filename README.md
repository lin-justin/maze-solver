# Maze Solver

A Maze Solver implemented in Julia using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

[Dijkstra's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes *a* and *b*. The algorithm picks the unvisited vertex with the lowest distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, and updates the neighbor's distance if it is smaller.
